We'll use the simplest of tasks, word counting, to illustrate the difference between a scalable and non-scalable algorithm.

Within the field of Natural Language Processing a lot of thought goes into what specific tokenizing makes most sense for a given task. For example, you might choose to remove punctuation or to consider punctuation symbols  'tokens' in their own right. __In this question you'll use the Python `re` module to create a tokenizer to use when you perform WordCount on the _Alice In Wonderland_ text.__\n",

So the number of comparisons, \"NoC\" as a function of the list size, n is: $NoC(n) = n-1 + n-2 + \\cdots + 1 = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ because the first word will need to be compared with the rest of the n-1 words, and the second word will need to be compared with the rest of the n-2 following it, so on and so forth. Therefore, the number of comparisons that need to be made in the worst case is $3008 \\cdot 3009 / 2 = 4525536‬$. In addition, the Big O complexity of this algorithm in terms of the list size is $n^2$ for a list size of n.\n",

While it is not _required_ that you complete the assignments using this environment we cannot provide support for individual setups. We have done our best to provide a consistent experience. However there will inevitably be new issues that arise since the Machine Learning content in this course is closely intertwined with rapidly evolving infrastructure and since students come froma a range of backgrounds. We encourage you and your peers to help each other troubleshoot infrastructure challenges using the course slack channel and by submitting formal issues for our attention in the environment repo.\n",
