# Machine Learning at Scale

This is the repo for the assignments and notes for the class, Machine Learning at Scale. The assignments focus on implementing massively parallel processing (MPP) using the MapReduce framework. There are five assignments and their respective areas of focus are as follows:

* [Assignment 1](https://github.com/erikhou45/ml-at-scale/blob/master/Assignments/HW1/hw1_Workbook.ipynb): Introducing the concept of parallel processing.

* [Assignment 2](https://github.com/erikhou45/ml-at-scale/blob/master/Assignments/HW2/hw2_workbook.ipynb): Use Hadoop MapReduce to implement Naive Bayes algorithm

* [Assignment 3](https://github.com/erikhou45/ml-at-scale/blob/master/Assignments/HW3/hw3_workbook.ipynb):
    * Define the terms one-hot encoding, co-occurrance matrix, stripe, inverted index, postings, and basis vocabulary in the context of both synonym detection and document similarity analysis.
    * Explain the reasoning behind using a word stripe to compare word meanings.
    * Identify what makes set-similarity calculations computationally challenging.
    * Implement stateless algorithms in Spark to build stripes, inverted index and compute similarity metrics.
    * Apply appropriate metrics to assess the performance of your synonym detection algorithm.
 
* [Assignment 4](https://github.com/erikhou45/ml-at-scale/blob/master/Assignments/HW4/hw4_workbook.ipynb): Implement gradient descent to train a linear regression model using PySpark RDD API.

* [Assignment 5](https://github.com/erikhou45/ml-at-scale/blob/master/Assignments/HW5/hw5_workbook.ipynb): Implement Page Rank algorithm using Spark in a cluster.
